This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

- **Animated Splash Screen**: Displays a beautiful animation on app startup.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: Framework used for building mobile applications.
- **Expo**: Managed workflow for running and building React Native apps.
- **Axios**: Used for making HTTP requests to fetch weather data from the OpenWeather API.

## Setup & Installation

To get started with this Weather App on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

To install the required dependencies for the app, run the following command in the project root directory:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a2097eb-5c33-405b-ba11-5f355bc4ebcd)

This command installs all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file, including React Native, Expo, and other required libraries.

If you're using `yarn`, you can use the following command instead:

### 3. Running the App
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the app on your device or simulator.

To start the app in development mode, run the following command:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7ff049a-8ceb-40e4-850b-2f2a832a0676)

This will open Expo DevTools in your browser. You can scan the QR code displayed in the DevTools using the Expo Go app on your Android or iOS device to preview the app.

Alternatively, you can run the app on an iOS or Android simulator by following the instructions in Expo DevTools.

### 4. Customizing the API Key
The app uses the OpenWeather API to fetch weather and air quality data. To make requests, you'll need to use an API Key from OpenWeather.

1. Go to [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) and sign up for an API key.
2. Replace the placeholder API key in the `wishlist.js` and `weather.js` files with your own API key:

### 5. Add Fonts
The app uses a custom font (LexendGiga). Make sure to download the font and place it in the `assets/fonts/` directory. If the font is not required, you can remove the references to it in the code.
